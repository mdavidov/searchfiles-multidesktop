You're absolutely right! The headless backend is only for testing without visual output. For GUI development, you want to actually see your Qt application.
For GUI display, I recommend Solution 1 (VNC) because:

Uses X11 backend (--backend=x11-backend.so) which provides a real display
VNC lets you see the GUI from your macOS machine
Easy to connect - just use any VNC viewer

How to use it:

Run the VNC solution (Solution 1 from the artifact)
Connect VNC viewer to localhost:5900

On macOS: Open "Screen Sharing" app and connect to localhost:5900
Or use any VNC client like RealVNC Viewer

You'll see a Wayland desktop where your Qt app will appear
Build and run your Qt app inside the container:



Alternative: Solution 2 (WEB-BASED GUI) !!! opens the display in your
WEB BROWSER at http://localhost:6080/vnc.html - NO VNC CLIENT NEEDED !!!
Why different backends:

--backend=headless-backend.so = No display (testing only)
--backend=x11-backend.so = Real display via X11 (what you want for GUI)
--backend=rdp-backend.so = Remote desktop display (alternative to VNC)

The updated Dockerfile in Solution 4 now also includes GUI support with VNC, so you can see your Qt application's interface while developing!RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
